#What is OSSP?

OSSP stands for Open-Source Security Project. OSSP is a project from Software Secured (www.softwaresecured.com) that provides free vulnerability sweeps to popular open-source projects.

##What is a vulnerability sweep?

A vulnerability sweep is a proactive effort to find as many serious bugs as possible in the source code. A vulnerability sweep uses techniques such as static code analysis, automated and manual penetration testing, and manual security code review, among others.

##Why OSSP?

We started this project as our way of giving back to the [open-source? development? security?] community. Some time ago, Software Secured came up with a way to secure open-source code. That initative, Security Labs, wasn’t sustainable. However, we are sticking to our goal, and we launched OSSP to keep the mission alive.

##How does it work?

It’s simple. Users or developers of an open-source project submit the project for security review. Every few weeks, Software Secured picks a new project to review, usually the projects that receive the most votes.

##What are the differences between users, contributors, and owners?

When you vote, you have to specify your relationship to the project. Do you contribute to the project, are you the project lead (or one of the project leads), or are you a user of the project? When a project has more users, that tells us there is a greater need for security in that project. When a project has more contributors, we know that there are people ready to fix the issues we come up with. Finally, owners’ engagement tells us that the project leadership is on board.
